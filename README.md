# Disease Spread Simulation: Exploring Discrete Probability

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

This project simulates the spread of a disease through a networked population. The primary focus is **not** on creating a highly realistic epidemiological model, but rather on using the simulation framework as a tool to **explore and demonstrate various discrete probability concepts**. We investigate how different probabilistic assumptions for infection transmission, individual heterogeneity, and network structure influence the overall dynamics of the spread.

## Features

*   **Network-Based Simulation:** Models disease spread on a graph of individuals.
*   **SIR Model:** Individuals transition between Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered states.
*   **Multiple Graph Models:** Supports different network structures:
    *   Erdos-Renyi
    *   Barabasi-Albert
    *   Watts-Strogatz
*   **Modular Infection Models:** Allows for easy comparison of different transmission dynamics:
    *   **Independent Model:** Each infected neighbor poses an independent transmission risk.
    *   **Dependent Model:** Infection risk is a non-linear function of the number of infected neighbors.
    *   **Superspreader Dynamic Model:** Some individuals can become temporary superspreaders with increased infectivity.
*   **Configurable Individual Attributes:** Samples attributes like `immune_level` and `vaccine_effectiveness` from probability distributions.
*   **JSON-Based Configuration:** Flexible experiment setup using JSON files.
*   **Automated Outputs:** Generates infection curve plots and summary metrics (CSV) for analysis.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the simulation environment.

### Prerequisites

*   Python (3.9 or higher recommended)
*   `uv` (for environment and package management - highly recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Install `uv`** (if you haven't already):
    Refer to the official `uv` installation guide: [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
    A common method is:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd sim_disease 
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    uv venv  # Creates a .venv directory
    uv sync  # Installs dependencies from pyproject.toml into the .venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    (On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`)

### Verify Setup

Run a basic simulation to ensure everything is working:
```bash
python main.py configs/exp1_foundations/
```
This should create an output directory (e.g., `results/exp1_foundations/`) with plots and a CSV file.

## Running Simulations

The main script for running simulations is `main.py`.

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
python main.py <config_files_or_directory> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

*   `config_files_or_directory` (required): 
    *   Path to a single JSON configuration file.
    *   Paths to multiple JSON configuration files (space-separated).
    *   Path to a directory containing multiple JSON configuration files (a "suite").
*   `--output_dir <directory_name>` (optional):
    *   Specifies the base directory to save results. Defaults to `results/`.
*   `--comparison_name <name>` (optional):
    *   A name for the simulation run or suite. This is used for naming output subdirectories and plot titles. 
    *   Defaults to the input configuration file's stem (for single runs) or the directory name (for suites).

### Examples

*   **Running a Single Configuration:**
    ```bash
    python main.py configs/exp1_foundations/exp1_high_density_high_initial.json
    ```

*   **Running a Suite of Simulations (e.g., all configurations in a directory):**
    ```bash
    python main.py configs/exp_A_network_topology/
    ```
    This will process all `.json` files within the `configs/exp_A_network_topology/` directory.

*   **Specifying an Output Directory and Comparison Name:**
    ```bash
    python main.py configs/exp_A_network_topology/ --output_dir custom_runs --comparison_name topology_study_v1
    ```

### Output

*   Results are saved in a subdirectory within the specified `output_dir` (or `results/` by default). The subdirectory is named using the `comparison_name`.
*   **Plots:**
    *   `infection_curves.pdf`: Shows susceptible, infected, and recovered counts over time.
    *   `summary_metrics_grouped_summary.pdf`: Bar plots for key summary metrics (e.g., peak infected, total infected).
*   **Data:**
    *   `summary_metrics.csv`: A CSV file containing key metrics and configuration parameters for each simulation run in the suite.

## Configuration

Simulations are controlled by JSON configuration files located in the `configs/` directory. Each file defines the parameters for a single simulation run.

**Key Configuration Parameters:**

*   `simulation_name` (string, optional): A descriptive name for the simulation run.
*   `population_size` (integer): Total number of individuals in the network.
*   `graph_type` (string): Specifies the graph generation model. Options:
    *   `"erdos_renyi"`
    *   `"barabasi_albert"`
    *   `"watts_strogatz"`
*   `connections` (number): The meaning depends on `graph_type`:
    *   Erdos-Renyi: Probability `p` of an edge (0.0-1.0).
    *   Barabasi-Albert: Integer `m`, number of edges for new nodes (>=1).
    *   Watts-Strogatz: Integer `k`, initial number of neighbors (>=1). Also requires `rewiring_prob` (typically 0.0-1.0) within the config for WS graphs.
*   `initial_binomial_probability` (float): Probability that any individual is infected at Day 0.
*   `number_of_days` (integer): Duration of the simulation.
*   `individual_parameters` (object): Defines distributions (mean `mu`, std dev `sigma`) for:
    *   `immune_level`
    *   `vaccine_effectiveness`
    *   `contact_chance`
*   `infection_model` (object): Specifies the infection dynamics:
    *   `type` (string): Model type (e.g., `"independent"`, `"dependent"`, `"superspreader_dynamic"`).
    *   `recovery_duration` (integer): Days an individual stays infected.
    *   `infection_parameters` (object): Model-specific parameters (e.g., `base_prob_transmission` for independent model).

For detailed schema, refer to `SIMULATION_CONFIG_SCHEMA` in `src/config.py`. For concrete examples, see the README files and JSON configurations within the subdirectories of `configs/` (e.g., `configs/exp_A_network_topology/README.md`).

## Core Simulation Mechanics

*   **Population Network:** Individuals are nodes in a graph (`networkx`). The graph structure is determined by `graph_type` and `connections` (see Configuration section). Handled in `src/graph_setup.py`.
*   **Individual Attributes:** Sampled from distributions (configured via `individual_parameters`):
    *   `immune_level`: Base resistance (0.0-1.0).
    *   `vaccine_effectiveness`: Reduction in susceptibility (0.0-1.0).
    *   `contact_chance` (edge attribute): Baseline probability of effective contact. **Note:** This attribute is initialized but **not currently used** by infection models in `src/models/` for transmission probability calculation.
*   **Time Steps:** Discrete daily steps, up to `number_of_days`.
*   **SIR Model:** Individuals transition: Susceptible -> Infected -> Recovered.
    *   Recovery occurs after `recovery_duration` days (from `infection_model.recovery_duration`, defaults to 14).

## Modular Infection Models

Located in `src/models/`, these define how infection spreads. Chosen via `infection_model.type`.

1.  **Independent Model (`src/models/independent.py`)**
    *   Each infected neighbor is an independent transmission chance.
    *   `P_neighbor = base_prob_transmission * (1 - immune_level_susceptible) * (1 - vaccine_effectiveness_susceptible)`.
    *   `P_infection_overall = 1 - Î (1 - P_neighbor_i)`.
    *   Key config: `infection_model.infection_parameters.base_prob_transmission`.

2.  **Dependent Model (`src/models/dependent.py`)**
    *   Infection risk is a sigmoid function of the *number* of infected neighbors (`k`).
    *   `P_infection = sigmoid_base * (1 - immune_level_susceptible) * (1 - vaccine_effectiveness_susceptible)`,
        where `sigmoid_base = 1 / (1 + exp(-alpha * k + beta))`.
    *   Key configs: `alpha`, `beta` in `infection_parameters`.

3.  **Superspreader Dynamic Model (`src/models/superspreader.py`)**
    *   Individuals can stochastically become temporary 'superspreaders'.
    *   Superspreaders have a `superspreader_multiplier` applied to their base infectivity.
    *   Key configs: `p_becomes_superspreader`, `normal_base_infectivity`, `superspreader_multiplier` in `infection_parameters`.

## Experiment Suites Overview
