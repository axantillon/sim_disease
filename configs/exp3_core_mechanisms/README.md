# Experiment 3: Core Transmission Mechanisms - Independent Events vs. Cumulative Risk

## Focus

This experiment directly compares the two fundamental infection spread models outlined in the project: the Independent Infection Model and the Dependent (Sigmoid) Infection Model. The goal is to understand how their differing probabilistic assumptions about transmission lead to different epidemic dynamics, even when other conditions (like population structure and initial infections) are similar.

## Discrete Probability Concepts Explored

1.  **Independent Infection Model:**
    *   In this model, each infected neighbor of a susceptible individual represents an independent Bernoulli trial for transmission.
    *   The probability of infection from a single infected neighbor `i` is `P_i` (calculated based on `contact_chance`, susceptible's `immune_level`, and `vaccine_effectiveness`).
    *   The overall probability of the susceptible individual getting infected is `P(Infection) = 1 - Π(1 - P_i)` for all infected neighbors. This is the complement of the probability that *none* of the independent transmission attempts succeed.
    *   This explores how multiple independent, discrete chances of an event occurring combine.

2.  **Dependent (Sigmoid) Infection Model:**
    *   This model posits that the risk of infection is not simply a sum of independent chances but rather a cumulative effect that often exhibits a non-linear (threshold-like) response to the number of infected contacts (`k`).
    *   The probability is typically modeled using a sigmoid function: `P(Infection | k) = (1 / (1 + exp(-α * k + β))) * (1 - immune_level) * (1 - vaccine_effectiveness)`.
    *   `α` (alpha) controls the steepness of the probability curve with respect to `k`.
    *   `β` (beta) effectively shifts the curve, determining how many infected neighbors are needed to reach a significant infection probability.
    *   This explores how a count of discrete events (infected neighbors) can non-linearly influence the probability of another event (infection).

## Key Parameters to Vary

*   The primary variation will be the `infection_model.type` itself (`"independent"` vs. `"dependent"`).
*   For the `"dependent"` model, the `infection_model.infection_parameters` (`alpha` and `beta`) will be key to explore its sensitivity and different response curves.
    *   `alpha`: e.g., low, medium, high values to show shallow vs. steep curves.
    *   `beta`: e.g., values that shift the 50% infection probability point to different numbers of infected neighbors.

## Expected Outcomes

*   Highlight differences in epidemic curves (e.g., speed of takeoff, peak infection rates) generated by the two models under similar baseline conditions.
*   Demonstrate how the dependent model can lead to more 'explosive' outbreaks once a certain threshold of local infection density (`k`) is reached, compared to the more linear accumulation of risk in the independent model.
*   Show the sensitivity of the dependent model to its `alpha` and `beta` parameters.

## Example Configuration Files in this Suite:

*   `exp3_model_independent_baseline.json`
*   `exp3_model_dependent_baseline_A.json` (e.g., specific alpha/beta for a moderate response)
*   `exp3_model_dependent_baseline_B.json` (e.g., different alpha/beta for a steeper or shifted response)

*(These files will share common baseline parameters for `population_size`, `connections`, `initial_binomial_probability`, etc., primarily varying the `infection_model` block.)*
